Very well connected to the town centre (the room is in zone 2, tube jubilee, overground and Thames Link) and the airports (Luton and Gatwick  by train, Heathrow by tube and Heathrow express, Stansted by bus to Finchley Road). Very nice high road with easy access to local parks and Hampstead Heath. Nice coffe houses and bakeries as well as restaurants. <br />Kitchen use limited to coffee/tea.",
         "West Hampstead is, to all intents and purposes, just one street - West End Lane. It is located in the London Borough of Camden, in zone two of the London Underground. It borders Belsize Park/Finchley Road to the east, and Kilburn/Willesden to the west. In the north are Cricklewood and Golders Green, whilst to the south lie uber-refined St. John's Wood and Maida Vale. The area is home to three train stations (all, confusingly, called West Hampstead!) and is a bona fide yuppie stronghold.<br />Though West Hampstead is hardly a place that springs to mind when you think nightlife, it has a smattering of good restaurants, pubs and bars. On the whole, the area's watering holes are towards the swankier (and pricier) end of the spectrum, and places tend to feel more mature feel than, say, Camden Town.<br /><br />In terms of nightclubs, Lately on West End Lane is a charming old-school dancing spot, whilst the Lower Ground Bar (also on West End Lane) flaunts its status as \"West Hampstead's Premi",

It retains its 'urban grit' and cool edge. <br /><br />We are located in travel Zone 2 which means not right next to the busy, noisy tourist traps, but in a place where it's fairly quick to get to central London and there is the space and beautiful garden instead! The full postcode is E9 6DW so you can see for yourself. <br /><br />New cafes, bars, pubs and clubs have been springing up on our doorstep for some years or so and there are lots of nice restaurants nearby if you don't always want to travel into town. There are also City Farms, museums, and lovely walks along the canal and River Lea just 15 minutes' walk away.<br /><br />There still is evidence of social problems which you can't really get aw",

Just north of my area is Vauxhall, which has been christened 'VoHo' because of the mix of bohemian shops, gardens, cafes and bars. <br />It is also close to the American Embassy (25 minute walk) for guests needing to attend to visa applications.<br />Other cool neighbourhoods nearby are  Kennington, Clapham and Brixton. <br /><br />The Tate Britain gallery is just across the river and the South Bank Centre is a few stops away in the tube.",

         "This Modern/Epoque flat is a few minutes away from Regent's street and Oxford street, the Christmas shopping ground zero streets of London. A home away from home. Perfect spacious apartment to be in Christmas time.",
         "Neatly tucked away between the wealth of Marylebone, the edgy energy of Soho and the grandeur of Bloomsbury, Fitzrovia is peaceful and attractive, home to small media organisations, small pubs and small restaurants and a smattering of decent hotels. Wide streets lined with tall buildings in Victorian brick mingle with cosy side alleys, with a variety of architectural styles from the eighteenth century to the present day, all of it dominated by the BT Tower, one of London’s tallest and most iconic buildings. Tottenham Court Road is the major shopping street, and the best place in London to look for home furnishings and electronic goods. The area around Oxford Street mixes good high street shops with pubs and bars catching the overflow from Soho’s nightlife.",
